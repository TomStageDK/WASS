Installation
======================
WASS is developed on CentOS 6.x and some of the Dependencies are available as native .rpm packages either from base or atomicorp yum repositories (http://www.atomicorp.com/channels/).

WASS is mainly dependent on the ZAProxy, since its proxy is used by all the other Web Application Scanning tools.
