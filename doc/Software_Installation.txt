TODO: implement installation information for all the tools used by WASS on a CentOS 6.x system.

This document will describe how to install the different software, on CentOS 6.x, that is used by WASS.

Joomscan:
	Download the latest version of Joomscan from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/joomscan/files/joomscan/latest/
	You could use these commands:
	cd /tmp
	wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/joomscan/files/joomscan/latest/joomscan-latest.zip
	cd /opt
	unzip /tmp/joomscan-latest.zip .
	cd joomscan-latest
	chmod 755 joomscan.pl
	
	Joomscan is dependent on some other Perl modules, so install them:
	yum install perl-WWW-Mechanize.noarch perl-Time-Piece.x86_64 -y
	
	You should now be able to run the Joomscan software.
