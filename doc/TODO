This is the WASS project road map / ToDo list:

Make sure that W3af (Both 1.1 and 1.6), Wapiti and OpenVAS-6 works, and that the scans runs without errors.

Make sure that the -u (exclude url) function is working for all relevant scanners.

Optimize the general program structure.

Implement an xml parser / converter to the Simple Software Vulnerability Language (SSVL) or OWASP Data Exchange Format Project format,
for all the Web Application scanners that support XML output.

Implement a per scan config file, so it would be easy to do a follow up scan. This could / should handle:
	Target to scan: ex. zero.webappsecureti.com
	Port to scan: ex. 80, 8080
	application path: ex. /
	The Customer name: ex. Your Company Name
	Type of scan to do ex. W3af, Info, and so on?
	Username
	Password
	Login URL
	Type of Login: Basic or form
	exclude url: ex. logout, exit (This will be converted into regex for the software that can use it, and remain as a string for the software that uses that)

Get the integration to Threadfix working, this is dependent on a working Threadfix installation.

Implement a progress file so we can pick up a failed scan, and complete it without starting all over.
