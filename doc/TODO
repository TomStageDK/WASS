This is the WASS project road map / ToDo list:

Make sure that the following are working as they should:
	W3af (1.1)
	OpenVAS-6

Test the implementation of:


Make sure that we don´t run the SSLyze and SSLScan on servers that don´t have SSL enabled

Make sure that the -u (exclude url) function is working for all relevant scanners.
(The code should be in place, we just need to test this, both with the -e / --exclude parameter and without to see if the default regex string gets set)

Optimize the general program structure, and check that all the params this software is using are defined in the wass object, with getters and setters,
and that obsoletes are deleted from the object.

Before we can implement Reportlab we need to be finished with the WASS XML layout based on the DEF definition.

Implement Reportlab:
ReportLab: http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/

?????Implement the running of the processes either in common or a new module?????

Implement an xml parser / converter to the OWASP Data Exchange Format Project, for all the tools that support XML output.

Implement SQLMap for the relevant XML result files (This will properly be implemented for the WASS XML format.

Implement a per scan config file, so it would be easy to do a follow up scan. This could / should handle:
	Target to scan: e.g. zero.webappsecurity.com
	Port to scan: e.g. 80, 8080
	application path: e.g. /
	The Customer name: e.g. Your Company Name
	Type of scan to do e.g. W3af, Info, and so on?
	Username
	Password
	Login URL
	Type of Login: Basic or form
	exclude url: e.g. logout, exit (This will be converted into regex for the software that can use it, and remain as a string for the software that uses that)

Get the integration to Threadfix working, this is dependent on a working Threadfix installation.

Implement a progress (XML) file so we can pick up a failed scan, and complete it without starting all over.

Working on:
TheHarvester http://code.google.com/p/theharvester/


Implement these tools (in no particular order):
Web Scanner:

uniscan https://sourceforge.net/projects/uniscan/
Grabber http://rgaucher.info/beta/grabber/
WebShag http://www.scrt.ch/en/attack/downloads/webshag (This will be run 3 times, 1: -m spider 2: -m fuzz 3: -m uscan
